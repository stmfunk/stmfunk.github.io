So you maybe familiar with the technique used to tell if an egg has gone bad: you put it in a glass of water and if it floats it's rotten. It's a useful trick especially given that the dates printed on eggs are incredibly unreliable. Eggs can last up to five weeks after the date given on them. 

Eggs are quite remarkable. The mix of amino acids matches almost perfectly human nutritional need. It contains the highest quality protein available to us and it is rich in Vitamin D. Equally amazing is the hen. The hen produces an entire egg every 24 hours. Think about the size of a hen compared to the size of an egg. That is allot of protein to produce and it also means that a chicken goes through an entire reproductive cycle every 24 hours. Compare that to almost every other bird, many of which produce a batch of eggs once a year. 

An egg in a fridge ages 1 day for every week an egg is out of the fridge. This is because the combination of the eggs own protective enzymes works very well with the refrigeration to prevent bacterial growth. But what is causing the decay? An egg is seemingly sealed. Well for starters an egg is not sealed. An eggshell is permeable which is why the chicken birth canal coats the egg in a kind of fluid. This fluid is the reason why American eggs are more dangerous than European eggs: the American egg packagers wash their eggs removing this coating and allowing salmonella to enter the egg. The reason an egg floats when it goes bad is because as the egg ages it loses water through the porous shell. This causes the air pocket inside the shell to expand. The horrible smell of a rotten egg is a combination of bacteria breaking down the protein in the white, and a reaction that takes place between the iron of the yolk and the sulfur in the white.
