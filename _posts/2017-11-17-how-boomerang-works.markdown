I thought of this question and I assumed it would be a simple answer but it turns out the physics behind it is actually quite involved.

The design of a boomerang is basically two air foils attached to each other at about a 70 degree angle. So in essence a boomerang is a disembodied propeller. The device is not, as I’ve always believed, symmetrical in fact each side of the boomerang has a leading edge one facing inwards and one facing outwards as well as a trailing edge which is the opposite for either side.

A boomerang has to be thrown vertically at a specific angle to work correctly. It is thrown in such a way that the leading edge always faces forward during the top of the spin. Now the physics. The airfoil produces a force depending on the speed at which it is traveling through the air and this force is perpendicular to the direction of the air flow. Because the boomerang is spinning the top of the boomerang is moving faster than the bottom hence the lift produced by the top of the boomerang is greater than the bottom. The next phenomenon at work is gyroscopic progression. When an object is spinning a force applied to it appears to act greatest at about 90 degrees from the place where it was applied. So the force applied at the top of the boomerang in reality acts at the middle of the boomerang. This constant force being applied causes the boomerang to turn around as it spins. This was a concept it took me a while to get as most of the diagrams and graphics don’t give a true picture of the actual motion of the boomerang. When I watched an actual boomerang thrower at work I finally got it. The force of the throw has little to do with the path of the boomerang. All the boomerang’s velocity comes from the propeller action or at least most of it. The spinning motion produces a basic force which pulls the boomerang in a direction perpendicular to its spin. The angle it is thrown at must be correct to cancel out the various forces pulling it down and what not. The progressing tilt I explained earlier causes this direction to change i.e. the boomerang traces a circle corresponding to the change in tilt. I recommend you actually look at some videos of them being thrown correctly to understand, because most of the people explaining haven’t a clue.
