So I was interested in this disease because I personally suffer from it sometimes. It manifests as this irresistible urge move. I normally get it in my legs generally at night if I have a hard time sleeping. It almost feels like a gigantic itch over an entire region of your body although some people even describe it as painful.

The disease is also known as Willis-Ekbom syndrome. It is poorly understood but according to some research it seems to relate to a combination of glutamate and dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that has a major role in sleep and relaxation. The condition normally manifests itself at night with patients being unable to switch off and relax their motary functions. Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in humans (which means it is responsible for a traversal of a stimulus) and is connected with the body being in an aroused state.

Currently people are treated for RLS are treated using dopamine supplements. People who suffer from RLS tend to get significantly less sleep than the average adult, however they do not report excessive sleepiness during the day. Also the dopamine supplements given to RLS sufferers does not seem to aid the insomnia patients experience. Scientists believe this is connected to higher levels of glutamate which can cause a state of hyperarousal. Drugs that reduce glutamate levels have yet to be trialled as a treatment for RLS.
