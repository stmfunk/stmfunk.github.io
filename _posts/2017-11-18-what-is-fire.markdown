I've often wondered what you are actually looking at when you see a fire. What is the actual flame made from? I know the basics i.e. the fire triangle, that its basically an oxidation reaction but I want to know more. I used to think of a flame as a kind of accelerated decomposition, or an exciting kind of rot. But I think rot is more of a biological process, for example is rust a kind of rot? This might just be a case of labels here but I am fascinated by the process. So now I'm going to learn as much as I can about fire, what makes something flammable, different types of fire, why are they different colours, etc.

So the basic definition of fire is: 
> Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.

Rust is not considered a fire because it is a different type of reaction (a single replacement reaction as opposed to a combustion reaction). Also it turns out "combustion" doesn't just mean fire: combustion is burning, while fire is the physical object. The flame itself is made from carbon dioxide, water, oxygen and nitrogen. A flame is produced when heat causes a fuel source to vaporise. The vaporised molecules then react with oxygen in a highly exothermic reaction (in most cases) the heat of which causes a chain reaction. Smoke is simply left over combustion materials that have decomposed at high temperature and reacted with each other. I'm guessing here but I have noticed that smoke doesn't actually form at the tip of a fire usually. It generally forms a short distance above it and I believe it is because at the higher temperature it is clear and it becomes opaque as it cools. A flame glows because the heat of the reaction causes the electrons in some of the gaseous components to become excited which releases photons. Now we are used to fires being from coal or wood or something but many things can cause fire, and the flames are not always visible nor are they always hot. They only need to be hot enough to cause a chain reaction of vaporising fuel. This explains why some fuels light much easier than others and especially why gas is so explosively flammable. 

A flame has an interesting behaviour in that it seems fight against gravity always moving upwards. This is because the shape of a flame is almost entirely determined by gravity. The heated gas is pushed upwards by convection currents in the air simultaneously pulling colder, more oxygen rich air inwards at the bottom, continuing the cycle. The flame is curved at the edge because the outer layers cool more quickly hence the reaction stops there sooner. In a low gravity environment fires often burn suffocate themselves unless there is an air current present, because the spent fuel is not cycled out and it's buildup on the outer edge of the fire prevents oxygen reaching the fuel at the centre.

A fire's oxidizer need not be oxygen, for example you can oxidize burning hydrogen with chlorine which produces gaseous hydrochloric acid (scary thought). The color of a flame is determined by a number of factors. The first is of course the emission spectrum of the material in being burned, which causes the excitation of electrons in the molecules to release photons of different spectrum. It also has to do with black body radiation (which I don't fully understand but I might make that a future topic). The most important factor is the availability of oxygen and it's mixture through the fuel which changes the temperature of the flame again affecting the emission spectrum. If the temperature of flame is hot enough the gas can become ionised forming plasma which is technically the forth state of matter. This is the type of flame present in a plasma cutter for example or a Bunsen burner, and in these cases is a blue flame. Yellow flames are often caused by the amount of soot present in a fire. The hottest flames are white, and a fire's temperature can be judged by how white it appears.

Any material that can be oxidised rapidly can be burned. If an object is too conductive it may dissociate heat too fast and hence be unable to burn. So there you have it. I think I've answered most of the questions I set out to answer here, I must say it was fascinating to learn about.
