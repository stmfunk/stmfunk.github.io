I've always wondered what exactly a steroid is. They seem to crop up in so many areas of medicine and they are so often the subject of controversy. What do they do? What are they used for? How are they made and what of? Let's investigate.

So there are two types of steroid: anabolic and corticosteroids. Chemically a steroid is an organic compound with four rings arranged in a specific molecular structure. Cholesterol is a form of steroid as is testosterone. This explains why steroid is such a broad ranging term with so many meanings across all of medicine. Let's try to break down the various places they crop up. Steroids have two principle uses: some are components of cell membranes which alter the materials the membrane will allow to pass through. They are also used as signaling molecules. 

We'll start with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are a class of steroids produced in the adrenal cortex or steroids than mimic their structure. Quoting from Wikipedia "Two main classes of corticosteroids, glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, are involved in a wide range of physiologic processes, including stress response, immune response, and regulation of inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, blood electrolyte levels, and behavior." A common example of corticosteroid is cortisol. It does a range of things such as help raise blood sugar and aid metabolism. Cortisone is another example. Cortisone's functions include immune suppression, helping reduce inflammation. Combined with adrenaline, it is one of the main hormones released when the body reacts to stress. Interestingly steroids are made using cholesterol in the adrenal gland. Generally in medicine corticosteroids are administered to suppress immune responses. For example they reduce swelling and mucus production in people suffering from asthma. 

Anabolic steroids are the more controversial variety. The term anabolic means that they create more complex molecules rather than breaking them down. They trigger an increase of protein production in cells, which leads to greater muscle size, strength and an increase of the ATP molecule which means the muscle has more energy.
