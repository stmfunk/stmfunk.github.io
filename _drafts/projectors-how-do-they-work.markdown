Digital projectors are ubiquitous in our lives. We use them to entertain, learn and display but how do they work? So there are four main types of projector in use today: Digital Light Processing(DLP), Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS), Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), or LED and Laser. There is also a class of projector based off CRT technology. We will start with this.

The technique behind CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) projectors is effectively the same as used in a traditional boob tube TV, except with the projector the image is projected forwards onto some form of canvas or flat surface and in a TV the image is projected from behind onto a phosphorus screen. Another key difference, one that is most obvious when you see an image of a CRT projector, is the three tubes. Traditional TVs have a single tube with three electron guns one for each colour. A CRT projector has three tubes each with a single electron gun. This means three images are being projected simultaneously a red, blue and green one. As a result the image needs to be calibrated precisely to line up all three channels, otherwise the picture can be blurry or distorted. Each tube is fitted with a large lens to magnify and focus the image. While CRT projectors have many drawbacks: expensive to purchase and power, very hot when running, difficult to calibrate, heavy and difficult to transport; they are still used today for their excellent picture quality.

A more modern technology is the DLP projector. This technology is seriously bad-ass. The idea is to physically manipulate light with moving mirrors in a form light a binary computer. It's incredibly precise and exactly timed. So basically you have a large lamp (like any projector) which shines onto an array of mirrors. Each mirror is responsible for one pixel of the image. Now these mirrors are really tiny, like fraction of a hair tiny. Each one is hinged at the center, and controlled with a matrix. The mirror can tilt either toward the lens (on) or away (off) allowing binary control over the pixel. By flickering quickly the image can be made grey. Now to add colour to an image the projector contains a spinning colour wheel that splits the light into red, green and blue. The DLP chip synchronises with this disk flickering the pixel different colours at different amounts. Now tell me that isn't mental? 

A similar but somewhat less awesome technology is LCoS or Liquid Crystal over Silicone.
