This is a new section I'm working where I just go in debt into some convoluted notion I dredged from my brain swamp and want to discuss somewhere. I'm not sure how frequently I'll update this or even if it will continue. Anyway here it goes.

I was laying in bed the other night, unable to sleep as I suffer from frequent bouts of insomnia. Anyway I got to thinking about the nature of thought. I've read about the impact language has on our brains, how we think, how we relate to the world. For example the Russian language has no word for "pink" but it does have a word for light blue. As a result the Russians are much worse at recognising the colour pink but much better at recognising light blue. The fact that they have a word for it affect their entire view of the world.
